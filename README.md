# betweenthepipes

`betweenthepipes` is an R package that currently holds two tutorials, created with [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html).

### How to Access

First, download this package via Github: `devtools::install_github("meghall06/betweenthepipes")`

Once the package has been downloaded, there are two options to access the tutorial. You can access each tutorial individually in your browser: `learnr::run_tutorial("intro", package = "betweenthepipes")` and `learnr::run_tutorial("data_manip", package = "betweenthepipes")`. Or, if you have an RStudio version 1.3 or later, there should be a Tutorial pane in the upper right corner (near Environment and Git). That pane should list all the tutorials available from the packages you've downloaded.
